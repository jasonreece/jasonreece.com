			"description": "I didn’t always know I wanted to be an Android Developer. In fact, it happened in the midst of a major life change. I struggled, like many college graduates, to figure out what I wanted to do in life. With a B.A. in Political Science and a M.S. in Sports Management, I knew I could be a lawyer or a politician, or work in an athletics department. But none of those really appealed to me.",

If I am wrong about any of my assertions here, please do not hesitate to correct me.  This is all still just a working understanding.If you haven’t used \u003ccode\u003eDeferred\u003c/code\u003e yet, I encourage you to give it a shot.  I will admit, that the initial learning curve was kinda steep for me, but once I got past that, I could follow “the pattern” and it wasn’t tough to use at all.  Much like learning swift optionals, I had to wrap my head around it before I could fully embrace it.  Once you embrace it, you wonder how you could live without it.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
