    <li> In order to test how subscripts and superscripts (<code>sub</code> and <code>sup</code> markup) work inside running text, we need some dummy text around constructs like x<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O (where subscripts occur). So here is some fill so that you will (hopefully) see whether and how badly the subscripts and superscripts mess up vertical spacing between lines. Now superscripts: M<sup>lle</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup>, and then some mathematical notations: e<sup>x</sup>, sin<sup>2</sup> <i>x</i>, and some nested superscripts (exponents) too: e<sup>x<sup>2</sup></sup> and f(x)<sup>g(x)<sup>a+b+c</sup></sup> (where 2 and a+b+c should appear as exponents of exponents).</li>

    <li> the command <code>cat</code> <var>filename</var> displays the file specified by the <var>filename</var> (<code>var</code> markup used to indicate a word as a variable).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some of the elements tested above are typically displayed in a monospace font, often using the <em>same</em> presentation for all of them. This tests whether that is the case on your browser:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <code>This is sample text inside code markup</code></li>
    <li> <kbd>This is sample text inside kbd markup</kbd></li>
    <li> <samp>This is sample text inside samp markup</samp></li>

    <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span> In order to test how subscripts and superscripts (<span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>sub<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> and <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>sup<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> markup) work inside running text, we need some dummy text around constructs like x<span class="nt">&lt;sub&gt;</span>1<span class="nt">&lt;/sub&gt;</span> and H<span class="nt">&lt;sub&gt;</span>2<span class="nt">&lt;/sub&gt;</span>O (where subscripts occur). So here is some fill so that you will (hopefully) see whether and how badly the subscripts and superscripts mess up vertical spacing between lines. Now superscripts: M<span class="nt">&lt;sup&gt;</span>lle<span class="nt">&lt;/sup&gt;</span>, 1<span class="nt">&lt;sup&gt;</span>st<span class="nt">&lt;/sup&gt;</span>, and then some mathematical notations: e<span class="nt">&lt;sup&gt;</span>x<span class="nt">&lt;/sup&gt;</span>, sin<span class="nt">&lt;sup&gt;</span>2<span class="nt">&lt;/sup&gt;</span> <span class="nt">&lt;i&gt;</span>x<span class="nt">&lt;/i&gt;</span>, and some nested superscripts (exponents) too: e<span class="nt">&lt;sup&gt;</span>x<span class="nt">&lt;sup&gt;</span>2<span class="nt">&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</span> and f(x)<span class="nt">&lt;sup&gt;</span>g(x)<span class="nt">&lt;sup&gt;</span>a+b+c<span class="nt">&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</span> (where 2 and a+b+c should appear as exponents of exponents).<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
